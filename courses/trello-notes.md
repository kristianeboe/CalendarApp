# Notes for Trello
==================

## What is Trello?

GTD. Project planning. Cards in lists in boards with members.

## How do you use Trello?

Press `?`

### Cards

- Informative title
- Describe the card using Markdown. Markdown is fucking epic.
- Due date
- Assign members (`m`)
- LABELS <3 (use 1-9) #>
- Comments!!!!!!!!
- Subscribe

And?

### Lists

- Collect cards in lists
- Lists are statuses (In progress, committed, done)
- Move cards to adjacent list using `< >`
- Subscribe

And?

### Boards

- Collection of lists
- Great to use a board for a e.g. a project.
- Press `b` to open the list of boards. Type to search.
- SUBSCRIBE
- Favourite

And?

### Filters

- I have yet to learn the power of this.
- Press `f`, search (for labels, card names, members +++)


Okay but when there are a ton of cards, how should I use Trello?

- Join a card (assign, hotkey `space` on a card)
- Press Q to see your cards
- Comment if you have questions/updates/time estimate changes, or if you can help out the assigned member
